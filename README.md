# Weather-App-API
App that displays current and future weather conditions of a city that the user searches. 

## Overview
 This is the 8th challenge of my bootcamp in Front-End Web Development. I have been able to demonstrate my knowledge of API usage along with basic concepts of JQuery in this challenge thus allowing myself to build a better foundation for my understanding of more indepth JavaScript concepts.

## Description
This challenge involved designing a weather dashboard using the OpenWeather API so that the user can find out what the weather is in a given city along with the forecast for the next 5 days. The previously searched cities will appear as buttons that the user will be able to click on to bring up the information quickly instead of typing the city in again.

## Credits

Study groups with Davou Jobbi, Andrea Fontana, Ioana Iosub, Thomas Jack, Lauren Eaton, Laura Kane held to help understand, troubleshoot and debug each others code.

Research on websites including W3Schools, MDN web docs and FreeCodeCamp viewing samples of code to help understand both the basic and more indepth concepts of javascript and JQuery.
